# pEmu-Big-Screen-Skin

This skin removes the rom &amp; game info box
I've also adjusted some colors for the "Big" & "Default" screen.
The "Big Screen" is particularly advantageous on the Switch.

Install:
- Copy the "skins" folder to your EMU folder

I´ve also adapted the big screen colors to the DEFAULT skin.
If you don´t like it, delete the file "config.cfg.override" in the DEFAULT folder.
