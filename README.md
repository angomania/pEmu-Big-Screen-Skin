# pEmu Big Screen Skin

A skin for Cpasjuste´s great pEmu Emulator:  https://github.com/Cpasjuste/pemu

This skin removes the rom &amp; game info box.
I've also adjusted some colors for the "Big" & "Default" screen.
The "Big Screen" is particularly advantageous on the Switch.

Install: Copy the "skins" folder to your EMU folder

I´ve also adapted the big screen colors to the "DEFAULT" skin.
If you don´t like it, delete the file "config.cfg.override" in the DEFAULT folder.
